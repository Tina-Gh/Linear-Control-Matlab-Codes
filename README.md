# Linear-Control-Matlab-Codes
Here, there is my Linear Control course project:

<strong>* Motor driven pondolum.zip</strong>

In this project, I have simulated and coded the Motor driven pondolum in Matlab and Matlab Simulink. The report is also available in the file.


<strong>* control systems lab_Servo motor project.rar:</strong>

In this project, I have simulated the Servo motor, its controller and output in Matlab Simulink. The report in Persian is also available in the file.
